# Used Cars Website - College project

Frontend part of one of college group projects, done by me with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains several pages, including homepage with some placeholder ads, registration page, profile page for logged users, single ad page with all the detailed information, and a few more. It's a template that was later upgraded to a full-stack application with all the necessary functionalities, made in Laravel.
